## Statement of purpose
I have always been motivated by transformation.

Transformation of mass, transformation of energy, and transformation of information in its multiple scenarios, that I decided to understand from a background that could explained it in its physic-chemical complexity.
It was however until a quite late moment on that journey I got to deviate my sight into beautiful, almost magical transformations.

Biological transformations, life transformations, and growth caught my attention and made me want to explore further in these domains with what I had at reach and being guided by what was being done near me,  approaches that are mentioned in detail in the « on science » and « on engineering » sections.

As of today, I cannot cease to be amazed by these processes, as they represent a revolution in pathology and medicine, an innovative milestone in chain supply industries, and most importantly, an interdisciplinary and integrative reconciliation between humanity and nature.
That’s why I recently decided that my vocation and main goal is to focus in synthetic and systems biology, in order to create and help create the projects that are going make those revolutions, milestones and reconciliations, real. 

I am convinced that interdisciplinary formation is key for groundbreaking development, and in that sense, I would like to be an exception to a world that classifies humans professionally in isolated Venn diagrams.
I try my best to keep on building abilities, living experiences, and cooperating in teams where art and society are the main grounds, even if science and engineering are the domains that I decided to follow academically and vocationally. 
These experiences are discussed in detail in the « on art » and « on society » sections, and due to them, I believe that I have gained a superior sensibility and wider outlook I am very proud of, not only because I feel like I have very valuable perspective to bring to science and engineering centered discussions, but also because I consider it to be a feature that makes me unique.

In conclusion, I believe that science, engineering,society, and art are dynamically interwoven following nature’s guide, led by human soul.
